ConfidentialCloud uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key at our developer portal.

ConfidentialCloud expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: <your_api_key>`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `<api_key>` with your personal API key.
