# Authentication

ConfidentialCloud uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key at our developer portal.

ConfidentialCloud expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code><api_key></code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "<%= config[:api_url] %>" \
  -H "Authorization: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

> Make sure to replace `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` with your API key.
