```shell
curl "<%= config[:api_url] %>" \
  -H "Authorization: <YOU_API_KEY>"
```

Confidential Cloud uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key at our developer portal.

Confidential Cloud expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: <YOU_API_KEY>`
