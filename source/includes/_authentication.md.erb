  -H "Authorization: <YOU_API_KEY>"
```

ConfidentialCloud uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key at our developer portal.

ConfidentialCloud expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: <YOU_API_KEY>`
